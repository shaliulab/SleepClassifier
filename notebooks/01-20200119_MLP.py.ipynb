    "### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A multilayer perceptron is a stack of fully connected (FC) layers\n",
    "2. Binary classification indicates the output can be treated as a coin toss(Yes/No or ClassA/ClassB)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides handlers to generate MLP models with varying number of hidden layers and nodes per layer using tensorflow.keras\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tensorflow is the software module, available here as a Python module) that provides the algorithms, data structures, etc necessary to do ML.\n",
    "* It is not the only one, but it is one of the few with great support, development and compatibility with GPU/TPU. This means the same code can be executed on an ordinary CPU, but also much faster chips like a GPU.\n",
    "* Another very good software module is Torch (and its Python module, pytorch). Tensorflow is made by Google and Torch by Facebook.\n",
    "* Keras runs on top of tensorflow to abstract away the fiddly details of the ML and provide default and reasonable settings for most things. It just simplifies the Tensorflow API (the Tensorflow commands)\n",
    "* Keras is to Tensorflow what simple English is to Shakespeare English (with the nuance that one can still implement advanced/complex models without the need to write actual Tensorflow code)\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is compatible with Snakemake. See Snakemake cell below if you wanna know more or disable Snakemake.\n",
    "You probably want to disable Snakemake if you want to provide the loomfile, etc manually just by hardcoding them in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow and details\n",
    "===========================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load software dependencies (Python modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Load data to Python as an AnnData object (from a loomfile)\n",
    "\n",
    " 2.1 The data can be selected via Snakemake or via hardcoded paths/variables\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define a model** -> Specify architecture i.e. how many layers, how many nodes, activation functions, etc\n",
    "4. **Compile a model** -> Provide a loss function, an optimizer and optionally performance metrics\n",
    "  * The loss function is the mathematical expression that evaluates the error i.e. the difference between truth and prediction.\n",
    "  The loss function depends on the prediction task. It's not the same if the model is performing regression, classification, etc. And even within classification (like this case) several losses could be used\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * The optimizer is the algorithm that given a loss (i.e. the output of the loss _function_) updates the weights (parameters) of the model in order to decrease said loss in the next training iteration. This can be done in different ways,\n",
    "  but most algorithms consist of a variation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the standard backpropagation algorithm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A performance metric quantifies in some way how well the model is doing. The loss is a performance metric itself, but it's hard to interpret in absolute terms.\n",
    "  For a classification task, the accuracy is one possible metric to look at (just % predictions are correct).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Train a model** -> Specify more details about how the training should happen (batch size, number of epochs, ...) and actually expose the model to the data and make it \"learn\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Batch size is the number of datapoints (fly brain cells in this case) that are passed through the network before the loss is updated. Each new value of the loss is computed on `batch_size` number of cells.\n",
    "  A default and common batch size is 32.\n",
    "  One could take the whole dataset as a batch, but that would take painfully long (it would have to give a prediction for ALL cells and then compute the loss) and the obtained loss is probably gonna be very similar to the loss obtained on a small sample (batch). One could also use a batch of 1, which is as fast as it can get, but then it can be very noisy. 32 is a nice value because it's a nice compromise between robust and efficient loss computations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * One epoch is fulfilled when the model has seen each datapoint (brain cell) once. This can happen in any number of iterations. If the batch size is equal to the size of the dataset, one iteration is one epoch. If the batch size is 1, then a number of iterations equal to the size of the dataset is needed for an epoch to be completed. If the batch size is 32, then we need `(dataset_size / 32 + 1)` iterations.\n",
